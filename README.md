# arabidopsis_alignments
arabidopsis alignments for the maf and the cap gene clusters. multiple alignment and visualization of the aligned genes and clusters. The genes that are used are At5g65050-At5g65080, containing 4 genes (Maf2-5 cluster of genes) and At2g13540 CBP80 Cap-binding protein 80. The corresponding genome assemblies and the download link to the assemblies along with the code to download, align, annotate and draw the alignments.
